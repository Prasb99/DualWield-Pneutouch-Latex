\section*{Abstract}
Virtual Reality (VR) experiences have made significant advances, but the challenge continues to be in creating the sensation of interacting with large objects. Current haptic systems and devices typically confine users to feeling interactions limited by the device’s size \cite{haptic_devices}. Many haptic glove feedback systems are constrained to the size of the user’s hand which makes it hard to interact with larger objects \cite{haptic_gloves}. Simulating large objects using small haptic devices is difficult. However, this approach presents many challenges when using a 1:1 mapping. To address the issue, this paper introduces DualWield Pneutouch. We demonstrate this concept through a single user wielding two Pneutouch devices at the same time, to simulate large objects by handling two small objects. This allows users to engage in the virtual environment while remaining comfortable and providing the feel of holding and operating the bigger object. The idea of handling large objects in VR is still a niche topic and not many advancements have been made in this sector. Through DualWield Pneutouch, we can bridge the gap between handling small and large objects in VR through one source.

Investigating further, we will delve into the knowledge addition, related works, components and system description of DualWield Pneutouch as well as future works, demonstrating its potential to improve haptic feedback and user interactions in VR.

\section{Introduction}
Dualwield Pneutouch is an extension of ‘Pneutouch’ which is an untethered, wrist-worn platform providing haptic feedback to users through the use of three different inflatable proxies which can inflate, deflate and pivot in the users' hands to provide a realistic haptic sensation of objects they are handling in VR. DualWield Pneutouch explores the idea of handling bigger objects in VR through the use of small objects. Traditional haptic systems, in addition to being bulky, can operate only on smaller objects in virtual reality \cite{haptic_devices} and it is challenging to hold a large physical object which provides haptic feedback due to its size and decreased usability. Despite Haptic-go-round providing feedback for large objects \cite{haptic-go-round}, the setup process appears to be fairly complicated as well as time-consuming. Haptic-go-round also restricts user movements to a specific area surrounded by the setup which leads to decreased usability and applicability.

The DualWield Pneutouch, a haptic system, addresses challenges encountered in VR scenarios that require more nuanced interactions with an innovative approach to simultaneously use two Pneutouch devices whilst keeping the system easy to operate, tetherless, and user-friendly.

\section{Related Works}
There are several works present which provide haptic feedback to simulate objects in VR. Examples include Haptic Links which utilize two handheld controllers to actuate physical connections in virtual reality \cite{haptic_links}. However, as both the controllers are attached to one another, it induces spatial restraints to the user’s movements when interacting with large objects which could hinder manipulation of objects requiring extensive physical space. Moreover, as the device provides usability through controllers, it does not provide haptic feedback in terms of realism of the object they are holding. Another example includes CLAW which is a handheld virtual reality controller that induces interactions for objects which include grasping and touching \cite{claw}. Despite the controller providing multiple functionalities to the user in terms of object interaction, its single-handed design limits the effectiveness of handling large objects that require two-handed interactions. The device is also not wireless which limits the user’s freedom of movement.

In contrast, DualWield Pneutouch offers distinct advantages over existing works. The system can replicate the experience of interacting with large objects in virtual reality (VR) without the need for complicated external mechanisms or tethering. As the system uses two Pneutouch devices at the same time, each interacting with a small proxy that represents a portion of a bigger object, the user does not have to worry about spatial limitations as the device is completely wireless and untethered. Another advantage includes the use of proxies which are carefully designed to replicate the feel of the virtual object held by the user. This induces a realistic and immersive experience ensuring user freedom in operating the system.

\section{Software and Hardware Component}
\subsection{Hardware}
As DualWield Pneutouch is an extension of Pneutouch, it uses the same traditional setup. The Pneutouch device comprises several components which include three physical proxies, servo arms, pneumatic motors and the electronic system. The inflatable shapes can be created out of 4 mm thick vinyl with an option of adding texture and made according to the user’s need. The arms are 3D printed and a tube is attached to the Pneumatic motors, through the arms, with a wire connected to the tube for controlled support. The device is powered by three Li-Po 9V batteries and the system controls the inflation and deflation of the proxies. The electronic control system includes an ESP32 Microcontroller that operates via REST API commands over wifi and is suitable with all major game engines.

When designing DualWield Pneutouch, there was significant consideration when choosing proxies for this demo scene. Each device is assigned one proxy which resembles a segment of the whole object. In our simulation, the steering wheel was the object to be handled by the two proxies. The tube-like proxies resemble a portion of the steering wheel, which in turn, ensures that the proxies accurately represent their corresponding structures in virtual reality.

For the demonstration, the user wears both of the devices on each arm where we then ensure that the fit is precise and the proxies are accurately delivered to the user's palm. When the scene initiates, the user can interact with the steering wheel which, in turn, will correctly deliver the proxies in the user's palm producing a gripping sensation, similar to holding a steering wheel.

In addition to the steering wheel, the scene also contains a gear shifter present on the right-hand side of the wheel. The movement of the shifter can also be experienced through the same proxy which was carefully designed to suit both, the shape of the shifter as well as a part of the steering wheel.

\subsection{Software}
The pivotal part for DualWield Pneutouch is to create a virtual reality scene in Unity consisting of the objects which would be ‘grabbable’ by the user through both the Pneutouch devices. We designed a scene to contain the steering wheel and gear shifter to be present in a way that the user can accurately feel the impression of driving a car in virtual reality. To grab and tilt the steering wheel, a grabbable script along with a ‘one rotate transformer’ script were utilized. The same scripts were used for the gear shifter but instead of rotation, a forward movement script was added to emulate the actual movement of a shifter.

After ensuring that both the objects provided satisfactory movement as well as hand grabbing, we attached ‘Pneutouch grab’ script to ensure the devices would actuate for the scene. Pneutouch needs one grab point for each hand which includes contact between the index and the thumb finger while curling up other fingers to mimic a hand grab which will trigger the actuation in Unity. We attach the script for both the objects in the DualWield Pneutouch scene to ensure proper actuation when the object is being held virtually.

\section{Development of Scene}
The demonstration of the scene contains a simulation of a car being driven with the perspective of the steering wheel and the user being the driver. The purpose of demonstrating this particular scene within the context of DualWield Pneutouch serves a few important goals. Firstly, it demonstrates how the system tackles the problem of creating a virtual reality experience when interacting with large objects. This scenario accurately illustrates the purpose of using two small objects to represent a bigger object. The demonstration shows how users can comfortably interact with and control large objects in virtual reality by mimicking the handling of a steering wheel and gear shifter in a virtual car scenario through the use of two proxies. The added control of operating the steering wheel with the left hand while changing the gear through the shifter with the right hand provides a realistic experience further enhancing the usability and validity of the idea. The scene initiates with the user wearing both the devices on each wrist and grasping the tube-like proxies to control the steering wheel virtually. The scene's development comprises a point-of-view shot of the car steering wheel, with a gear shifter situated on its right side. This decision was made in order to successfully illustrate the DualWield Pneutouch system's functionality because it fits with our objective of demonstrating how the system allows for realistic interactions with large objects in virtual reality. Through the simulation of a steering wheel and gear shifter in an automobile context, we hope to demonstrate how DualWield Pneutouch enables users to interact comfortably with large objects in a virtual reality setting. The scene will contain the simulation of a basic tilting motion for the steering wheel and users are able to hold the wheel, tilt it and also change the gear with the gear lever. This gives the users a sense of understanding as to how to handle the device and the object simultaneously.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
DualWield Pneutouch represents a significant advancement in the realm of haptic feedback for large objects through the use of small objects in virtual reality. Through the innovative use of two Pneutouch devices simultaneously, each interacting with a small proxy representing a part of the bigger object, the system provides a sizable contribution to virtual reality experiences. It also facilitates bilateral hand coordination which focuses on cooperative use of both hands to execute a particular task. Future work regarding the steering wheel demonstration shown above will include further development of the scene to add a track so that users can actually drive the car through DualWield Pneutouch. This addition will increase the usability of the system as more users would be engaging themselves to utilize this scenario for driving simulations and practice. Additionally, we will explore DualWield Pneutouch’s full potential by implementing it across various platforms through which larger objects can be stimulated with the use of this system through user input and personalization and thus exploring a broader range of applications.
